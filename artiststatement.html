	<h3>My art is inspired by the places I have traveled to and the people I have met; it is a visual representation of my adventures. I capture these places on film, as I find both film and the process itself to be like a journey, each equally rewarding. Like my trips, I don’t know what to expect once I develop my film and see my images.
	</h3>

	<h3>Film can be an expensive and risky process but, the photo quality of the film makes up for that. There is something very special that happens when you capture nature on film. The colors are vivid and the photo overall is warm. </h3>
	<br>
	<h3>My recent focus has been taking double exposure portraits, juxtaposing my friends and nature. As the images are all on film, it is never clear how the two images will overlap on each other. Sometimes it doesn’t work at all. Most of the time the images show both the person and the landscape I am trying to capture. There is something special about capturing people emerged in nature, exploring the connection between human and nature. </h3>
